Together with <strong>CVPR</strong> and <strong>ECCV</strong>, they are considered the top conferences in Computer Vision. ICCV is held every other year and is sponsored by <strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</strong>. And this year, ICCV 2025 is held in Honolulu, Hawaii with the span of 5 days: 2 days of workshops and 3 days of main conference.</p> <h1 id="what-is-a-workshop">What is a workshop</h1> <p>In ICCV, there are many workshops with a diverse range of topics including theorictal of representation learning to applications of computervision in robotis or medical. The workshop I participated is ‚ÄúThe 9th AI City Challenge‚Äù involves 4 different tracks: Multi-Camera 3D Perception, Traffic Safety Description and Analysis, Warehouse Spatial Intelligence and Road Object Detection in Fish-Eye Cameras. Personally, my team participate in Challenge Track 2. Traffic Safety Description and Analysis, which involves captioning and VQA for traffic video.</p> <h1 id="what-is-my-paper">What is my paper</h1> <h2 id="team">Team</h2> <ul> <li>‚Ä¶</li> </ul> <h2 id="journey">Journey</h2> <h3 id="initial-idea">Initial idea</h3> <h3 id="training">Training</h3> <h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3> <h3 id="submission">Submission</h3> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <h1 id="more-information">More information</h1>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="ICCV"/><category term="paper"/><category term="workshop"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a summary of the way I got to ICCV]]></summary></entry></feed>
